## Results
I think this gave fairly acurate reading of voter turn out and for which counties had the greatest turnout. For future elections, you could look deeper in to the counties and see which polling precinct has the highest turnout. We could adjust the script with the names of each precinct so we could get a reading of locations.  I think it would be beneficial to include the parties and break down voter turn out based on political party.
