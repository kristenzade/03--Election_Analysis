# Election_Anaylsis

## Overview of Project
This audit was to show how the turnout was in each county and how the election turn out was and which county had the highest turnout. 


### Analysis of Results For Each County

Arapahoe had a low turnout for voters at 24,801 and 6.7%.

Denver had the largest turnout with 306,055 voters and 82.8%.

Jefferson had a turnout of 38,855 and 10.5%. 

The winner of the election was Diane DeGette with 272,892 and 73.8%.

## Election summary

Over all this anaylsis worked great for this election and broke the data down in a way that is easy to understand.  In the future this could be repeated for a local election to find out which area within the city had the greatest turnout. It would be an idea to find out in areas of lower turnout what the number of registered voters is to compare turnout to registered voters. An age range of active voters could also help target a demographic to bring out more voters.
